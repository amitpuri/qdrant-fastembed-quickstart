## When to Use Each Method

### Dense Embeddings (BGE)
✅ **Good for:**
- General purpose semantic search
- Similarity search and clustering
- Most NLP tasks
- When you need good semantic understanding

❌ **Not ideal for:**
- Exact keyword matching
- When you need term-level control
- Domain-specific terminology matching

### miniCOIL
✅ **Good for:**
- When exact keyword matches matter
- But context and meaning are important
- Domain-specific search (medical, legal)
- Hybrid search scenarios

❌ **Not ideal for:**
- Pure semantic similarity tasks
- When you don't need keyword matching

### SPLADE
✅ **Good for:**
- When you need both lexical and semantic matching
- Domain-specific vocabularies
- Technical documentation search
- Term expansion capabilities

❌ **Not ideal for:**
- When pure semantic understanding is sufficient
- Simple similarity tasks

### ColBERT
✅ **Good for:**
- Complex, multi-part queries
- When word order and position matter
- Fine-grained relevance requirements
- Question-answering systems

❌ **Not ideal for:**
- Simple similarity search
- When storage/memory is limited

### Reranking
✅ **Good for:**
- As a second stage after initial retrieval
- When precision is more important than recall
- Domain-specific applications
- Limited result slots (top 5-10)

❌ **Not ideal for:**
- As the only retrieval method
- When speed is critical

## Decision Tree

### 1. Do you need exact keyword matches?
- **Yes** → Consider miniCOIL or SPLADE
- **No** → Use dense embeddings

### 2. Do you have complex, multi-part queries?
- **Yes** → Consider ColBERT
- **No** → Continue with current method

### 3. Do you need high precision in top results?
- **Yes** → Add reranking
- **No** → Current method is sufficient

### 4. Do you have domain-specific requirements?
- **Yes** → Consider hybrid approach
- **No** → Single method is sufficient

## Best Practices

### Getting Started
1. **Start with dense embeddings** for most use cases
2. **Add sparse methods** for keyword-heavy domains
3. **Use ColBERT** for complex, multi-part queries
4. **Always consider reranking** for production systems
5. **Combine methods** for hybrid search when possible

### Production Recommendations
- Use dense embeddings as your baseline
- Add miniCOIL for domain-specific search
- Use SPLADE for technical documentation
- Apply ColBERT for complex queries
- Always use reranking for final results
- Monitor performance and adjust accordingly

## Hybrid Approaches

### Dense + Sparse
- Combine dense embeddings with miniCOIL or SPLADE
- Weight the results (e.g., 70% dense, 30% sparse)
- Use for comprehensive search coverage

### Multi-stage Retrieval
1. Initial retrieval with dense embeddings
2. Expand with sparse methods
3. Rerank final candidates
- Best of all worlds approach

### Query-dependent Selection
- Use dense for semantic queries
- Use sparse for keyword queries
- Use ColBERT for complex queries
- Adaptive approach based on query type

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Requirements
- **Dense**: Low memory, medium storage
- **Sparse**: Medium memory, low storage
- **ColBERT**: High memory, high storage
- **Reranking**: High memory, no storage

### Integration Complexity
- **Dense**: Simple integration
- **Sparse**: Medium complexity
- **ColBERT**: Complex integration
- **Reranking**: Medium complexity

### Scalability
- **Dense**: Excellent scalability
- **Sparse**: Good scalability
- **ColBERT**: Limited scalability
- **Reranking**: Limited scalability

## Implementation Examples

### Simple Dense Search
```python
from fastembed import TextEmbedding

embedding_model = TextEmbedding()
embeddings = list(embedding_model.embed(documents))
# Use with Qdrant for similarity search
```

### Hybrid Dense + Sparse
```python
# Combine dense and sparse results
dense_results = dense_search(query, limit=50)
sparse_results = sparse_search(query, limit=50)
combined = merge_results(dense_results, sparse_results)
```

### Multi-stage with Reranking
```python
# 1. Initial retrieval
initial_results = dense_search(query, limit=100)

# 2. Rerank top candidates
reranked_results = reranker.rank(query, initial_results[:20])

# 3. Return top results
return reranked_results[:10]
```
